### ðŸŽ® A Zelda Breath Of The Wild Durability modifier

Prototype of a Zelda BOTW durability modifier. This project has been archived.

- Nintendo Switch version of the game
- To use the modified files you will need a modded Switch
- The game files are to be extracted on your own
- Able to edit weapons durability
- There's no major bugs known, able to edit durability from 1 (one hit destroy the weapon, don't know why anyone would do thatâ€¦) to infinite (make games too easy)

##### ðŸ”­ Objective of this project

I bought a Switch at launch in 2017. Tried to play BOTW but hated the durability of the weapons. This project is an attempt to make me play it until the end and also a way to learn a bit more C#. This project has been archived in favor of a modular application making it more user friendly.
